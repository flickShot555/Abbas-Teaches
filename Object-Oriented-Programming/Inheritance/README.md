# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming 🚀

Welcome to the **Inheritance in OOP** repository! This repo contains beginner-friendly examples of inheritance implemented in multiple programming languages. Each file demonstrates how a **child class** inherits properties and methods from a **parent class**. 📚

## 🔥 Languages Covered
- 🐍 Python
- ☕ Java
- 🌐 JavaScript
- 🎯 C#

## 📂 File Structure
- `inheritance_python.py` - Python implementation
- `inheritance_java.java` - Java implementation
- `inheritance_javascript.js` - JavaScript implementation
- `inheritance_csharp.cs` - C# implementation

## 📝 Explanation
- The `Person` class acts as a **base class**.
- The `Teacher` class extends `Person`, adding a **subject specialization**.
- The example includes a method to introduce the person and a method to display teaching behavior.

## 🚀 How to Run
### Python 🐍
```bash
python inheritance_python.py
```

### Java ☕
```bash
javac inheritance_java.java
java Main
```

### JavaScript 🌐
```bash
node inheritance_javascript.js
```

### C# 🎯
```bash
csc inheritance_csharp.cs
InheritanceCsharp.exe
```
