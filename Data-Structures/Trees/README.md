# 🌳 Trees Repository

Welcome to the **Trees Repository**! 🚀 This repository is designed for **learning and teaching** the fundamental concepts of **Trees** in programming. It contains implementations of **Binary Trees** in multiple languages, making it easier for beginners to understand and compare different approaches.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository includes **Tree Data Structure** implementations in the following languages:

- 🐍 **Python** (`tree_python.py`)
- ☕ **Java** (`tree_java.java`)
- 💻 **C++** (`tree_cpp.cpp`)
- 🌐 **JavaScript** (`tree_javascript.js`)

## 📖 What You'll Learn

- **Tree Basics** 🌱 - Understanding nodes, edges, and binary trees.
- **Insertion in Trees** 🌳 - How to insert elements into a binary tree.
- **Inorder Traversal** 🔄 - Learn how to traverse a tree in an **inorder sequence**.
- **Comparison Across Languages** ⚖️ - Observe syntax differences in various programming languages.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 🔧 Run the Programs
