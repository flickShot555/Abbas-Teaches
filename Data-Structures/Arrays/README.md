# 📚 Arrays - Mastering the Basics!

🚀 Welcome to the **Arrays** repository! This project is designed to help beginners grasp the fundamentals of arrays through **hands-on coding examples** in **Python 🐍, Java ☕, C++ 🔵, and JavaScript 🟡**.

## 📖 What You'll Learn  
✅ Understanding **arrays** and how they store data  
✅ Performing **basic operations**: insert, update, delete, traverse  
✅ Implementing **array-based problems** in multiple languages  
✅ Gaining confidence in **multi-language programming**  

---

## 🛠️ Languages Covered
| Language      | File Name     | Execution Command |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 🐍 Python     | `arrays.py`   | `python arrays.py` |
| ☕ Java       | `Arrays.java` | `javac Arrays.java && java Arrays` |
| 🔵 C++        | `arrays.cpp`  | `g++ arrays.cpp -o arrays && ./arrays` |
| 🟡 JavaScript (Node.js) | `arrays.js` | `node arrays.js` |

---

## 📝 Code Implementations

Each language includes a **Student Grades Calculator** as a starting example:  
✅ Accepts **user input** for grades  
✅ Computes **average, highest, and lowest grades**  
✅ Demonstrates **looping, indexing, and functions**  

**💡 More array-based projects will be added soon!** Stay tuned! 🎯
